# 2D-enemy-vs-user

2D game programmed in Java

How to play: the user can move around the player using 'd', 'a', 'w', and 's' keys

Objective: the goal for the player is to get as many items and earn points (score) without losing all of its health

Functions: items will appear one at a time randomly as the player collects them; the player gets a grace time when it collides an enemy before the player loses health again

Note: Health will decrement by 10 if the player collides with an enemy. Score will increment by 10 if the player collects an item.
